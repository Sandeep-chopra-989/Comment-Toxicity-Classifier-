# 🛡️ Comment Toxicity Classifier

**Python • Machine Learning • NLP • Neural Network**

A simple ML project that detects whether a comment is **toxic or non-toxic** using NLP preprocessing and a neural network model.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project processes **50,000+ comments** and classifies them using a deep learning model.
It uses standard NLP techniques — tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and embeddings — to clean and transform text before training.
